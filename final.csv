Vollebekk is located in the Bjerke district in the north-east of Oslo, midway between Lunden Hageby in the east and Risløkka in the west. Here, OBOS plans to build a total of around 1,000 new homes and the first homes have already been handed over to their new owners in summer 2019 and spring 2020. The homes are located close to the Vollebekk subway stop and from here you can get to Oslo S in just 13 minutes, or to Storo on 8 minutes with either lane 4 or 5! In addition, there are several buses (no. 58 0g 60) - and trains (Alna Station) in the immediate area.

About the area
Close to the city and close to the fields.
It is a short distance to the center and you also have Lillomarka within walking distance. The area around the project is a well-established residential area and precisely in the development area, old industry is now being rehabilitated in favor of urban and modern apartments. This will be a high-quality urban and residential area in the far north of Hovinbyen.

The area around Vollebekk today mainly consists of detached houses, terraced houses and apartments in low-rise blocks surrounded by green areas. The new apartment buildings are built around green and safe outdoor areas consisting of pleasant backyards and yards and environmental streets that give priority to gentle road users. Developing Vollebekk is about giving the area a lasting boost where emphasis is placed on urban and living quality, and where exciting transitions and a good balance between public and private outdoor areas are established.

Vollebekk will be an urban area where people can live their lives with shops and businesses that meet everyday needs, and if desired, you can live there without a car. It is also a goal that the new district should capture the established local environment's need for further offers and qualities: This will be the local area's new meeting place.

Among Vollebekk's closest neighbors is Bjerkedalen Park. The park has been a prestigious project for Oslo municipality, covering over 40 acres. The park consists of a café, ball courts, ice skating rink, toboggan runs, seating areas, barbecues, benches, a nursery and cultivated green areas. There are paths through and around the entire park, various park and ornamental trees and flowers to create colorful and pleasant surroundings. The park won Oslo City's architecture award in 2015. The

surroundings are family-friendly and the road is short to several nurseries, family nurseries and schools for all levels. In the autumn of 2017, Vollebekk primary and secondary school opened, which is 2 minutes' walk away. In 2019, Vollebekk opened a kindergarten next to the school.
